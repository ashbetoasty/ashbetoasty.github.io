        <h2>Wrestling</h2>
        <p class="justify">There are many different kinds of "wrestling". Professional Wrestling, Lucha Libre Wrestling, roughing around. However, <em>real</em> wrestling is Olympic Style Wrestling. Most people would consider Wrestling as the hardest spor out there. Sure, other sports are pretty hard to do, and require a certain skil that you might not have. But, Wrestling is something that everyone <em>could</em> do, just not something that every wants to. The objective of wrestling is to win, but there are a few different ways to achieve that win. As always, you could pin your opponent, which means putting them on their back around their shoulders for a 3-count. But if that's unattainable, you could always win by points. Each Wrestling match consits of 3 periods, each period varying in length from 1 minute to 3 minutes. To win by points, you just have to finish a match with more points scored that your opponent. However, there is another way to win by points... tech fall. A tech fall is when you score ennough points that you have a lead on you opponent by at least 15 points. Of course, you could always win if your opponent gets an injury during the match, but that's not a <em>real</em>.</p>

        <h2>Flag Football</h2>
        <p class="justify">I used to play some flag football at the park when I was younger. One time my team and I won the championship undefeated. I tried out for the school team in 6th Grade. I was told I made the team, but I had to quit the season for wrestling. I made the team again in 7th Grade, and we won 2 games, better than the last year and the few before that. I initially tried out for wide receiver and cornerback, but was moved to line-backer, and from there defensive line. On the D-line, I would always be on the right side, and me and the other person (left side, as there were only two of us on the line) This year, in 8th grade</p>
