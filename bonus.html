        <h2>Wrestling</h2>
        <p class="justify">There are many different kinds of "wrestling". Professional Wrestling, Lucha Libre Wrestling, roughing around. However, <em>real</em> wrestling is Olympic Style Wrestling. Most people would consider Wrestling as the hardest spor out there. Sure, other sports are pretty hard to do, and require a certain skil that you might not have. But, Wrestling is something that everyone <em>could</em> do, just not something that every wants to. The objective of wrestling is to win, but there are a few different ways to achieve that win. As always, you could pin your opponent, which means putting them on their back around their shoulders for a 3-count. But if that's unattainable, you could always win by points. Each Wrestling match consits of 3 periods, each period varying in length from 1 minute to 3 minutes. To win by points, you just have to finish a match with more points scored that your opponent. However, there is another way to win by points... tech fall. A tech fall is when you score ennough points that you have a lead on you opponent by at least 15 points. Of course, you could always win if your opponent gets an injury during the match, but that's not a <em>real</em> win.</p>

        <h2>Types of wrestling</h2>
        <p class="justify">There are three types of Wrestling: Folkstyle, Greco Roman Wresting, and Freestyle Wrestling. In Folkstyle, all the points are at the "base". When you are taken down, the ref. does not make you stand up, and if your opponent is down, you cannot lock your hands (or any part of your arms) together if they are above the waist, you can only lock hands if one arm is above the waist, and one is below. In Greco Roman, Things are mostly the same, except you cannot touch your opponent's legs, and vise versa. You can't even use your legs to trip. Also, if you take your opponent from their feet, straight to their back, it is 4 points. Your can also roll your opponent (when they are down) to get 2 points for each time their back is exposed to the mat. You <em>can</em>, however, lock you hands when your opponent is down, but the ref. will stand you both up if there is no action for around 5 seconds. In Freestyle, it is basically Greco Roman when you can touch the legs.</p>
