        <h2>High School</h2>
        <p class="justify">For High School, I really want to go to Milikan. Specifically, COMPASS. I think that the program will help let my artistic side flourish. I’m frequently told that I’m very gifted in art, but I just don’t do enough of it. I believe that COMPASS will fix that problem, as well as let me follow my interest of graphic design.</p>

        <h2>College</h2>
        <p class="justify">In all honesty, I don’t really know where I want to go to college. I prefer to look at what’s closer to the “now”, and worry about the future when it gets closer. But, that’s not saying that I don’t have goals. I do know, that I want to go to a good college, that will let me refine my skills in my current career interests at the time.</p>

        <h2>Career Interests</h2>
        <p class="justify">As of right now, I’m currently interested in graphic design. I would like to have a job as a graphic designer, but that’s just right now. In the future, my interests could possibly change, but now, I would like to be a graphic designer. Well, there’s something else I would equally like to be, if not more. I want to be a US Marine. I’ve wanted to be one as long as I can remember. I believe that if I keep up with my exercise, and get good grades in school, than I'll be able to do both.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p class="justify">My goal in the future (as of right now), is to join the Marines for a few years, get married and have a family, and get a job as a graphic designer. Well, those are extremely long term goals, ones that I can’t really achieve right now. Some goals I could do closer to now, are getting in to Millikan's COMPASS, and finally winning the Dominator belt from the super tournament (CAGWA wrestling).</p>
